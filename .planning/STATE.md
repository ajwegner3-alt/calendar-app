# Project State: Calendar App (NSI Booking Tool)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-11 — Phase 42.5 Plan 02 (prices.ts refactor) executed. 4-SKU nested map + reverse lookup + helpers shipped (`refactor(42.5-02) 6238b3e`); env-var contract refresh shipped (`refactor(42.5-02) 185b2d0`). Repo typecheck intentionally broken at 5 callsites in `app/(shell)/app/billing/page.tsx` (4) and `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts` (1) — owned by Wave 2 plans 42.5-03/05. Plan 42.5-01 manual `supabase db push --linked` still pending Andrew's handoff. Next: Wave 2 (Plans 42.5-03 checkout, 42.5-04 webhook, 42.5-05 billing UI) can run in parallel.

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-09 with v1.8 Current Milestone section)

**Core value:** A visitor lands on a service business's website, picks an available time slot in a branded widget, and walks away with a confirmed booking in their inbox — no phone tag, no back-and-forth.

**Current focus:** v1.8 — Stripe Paywall + Login UX Polish (3-tier model). Phase 41 shipped 2026-05-10. Phase 42 plumbing code-complete 2026-05-10. Phase 42.5 (Multi-Tier Stripe + Schema) is next.

**Mode:** yolo | **Depth:** standard | **Parallelization:** enabled

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v1.8 Stripe Paywall + Login UX Polish
**Phase:** 42.5 of 46 (+ inserted 42.5/42.6) — in progress (Wave 1 complete)
**Plan:** 42.5-01 + 42.5-02 complete; 42.5-03/04/05 pending (Wave 2)
**Status:** Wave 1 of Phase 42.5 complete. Plan 42.5-01 (plan_tier schema migration) shipped as `feat(42.5-01) e890334` — manual `supabase db push --linked` still owed by Andrew. Plan 42.5-02 (prices.ts refactor + env-var contract) shipped as `refactor(42.5-02) 6238b3e` + `refactor(42.5-02) 185b2d0` — `lib/stripe/prices.ts` rebuilt as 4-SKU nested map with `PRICE_ID_TO_TIER` reverse lookup and `getPriceId`/`priceIdToTier` helpers; `.env.local.example` documents 9 new env vars. Repo typecheck intentionally broken at 5 callsites — addressed by Wave 2. Wave 2 (Plans 42.5-03 checkout route, 42.5-04 webhook tier derivation, 42.5-05 billing 3-card UI) is unblocked and parallelizable.
**Last activity:** 2026-05-11 — Plan 42.5-02 executed: rebuilt `lib/stripe/prices.ts` with 6 named exports (`PRICES`, `PRICE_ID_TO_TIER`, `PriceTier`, `PriceInterval`, `getPriceId`, `priceIdToTier`); replaced 4 obsolete env vars with 9 new ones (4 PRICE_IDs + 4 *_CENTS + `NSI_BRANDING_BOOKING_URL`). Smoke test confirmed 4 distinct keys in reverse map, `priceIdToTier(unknown) === null`, server-only directive preserved.

## Accumulated Context

### Locked Decisions (must not be reopened in phase plans)

- **LD-01** stripe@22.1.1; `apiVersion: '2026-04-22.dahlia'`; pin forever
- **LD-02** No `@stripe/stripe-js`; hosted Checkout only; zero client-side Stripe code
- **LD-03** Customer Portal handles cancel/update-payment/invoices/plan-switch; no custom equivalents
- **LD-04** Paywall gate allows `trialing` and `active` only; locked = all other statuses
- **LD-05** Webhook idempotency via `stripe_webhook_events (stripe_event_id PRIMARY KEY)` + `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- **LD-06** Webhook MUST `await req.text()` before `constructEvent()` — never `req.json()` first
- **LD-07** Paywall middleware extends `lib/supabase/proxy.ts` inside existing `pathname.startsWith('/app')` branch; `/[account]/*` structurally exempt
- **LD-08** `past_due` = banner only, NOT lockout; only `unpaid`/`canceled`/trial-expired → redirect
- **LD-09** Existing v1.7 accounts: `trial_ends_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '14 days'` at deploy (NOT `created_at + 14 days`)
- **LD-10** Checkout return lag-window uses polling; webhook is canonical source of truth; no optimistic update
- **LD-11** Stripe-triggered emails route through `getSenderForAccount(accountId)`; Stripe receipts complement for dollar-amount emails
- **LD-12** AUTH-29 four-way enumeration-safety invariant preserved; magic-link helper identical wording for all users

### Roadmap Evolution

- **2026-05-10** — Phase 42.5 INSERTED after Phase 42 (Multi-Tier Stripe + Schema). Reason: mid-execution scope pivot from single-plan to 3-tier model (Basic / Widget / Branding). Phase 42 plumbing remains correct and is reused; only the prices map, checkout body, and billing UI need refactoring.
- **2026-05-10** — Phase 42.6 INSERTED after Phase 42.5 (Widget Feature Gating). Reason: Basic tier excludes the booking widget; need server-side gate on `/embed/[account]/[slug]` + owner embed-code page based on `plan_tier`.

### Locked decisions (3-tier model, 2026-05-10)

- **LD-13** Three tiers: Basic (Stripe), Widget (Stripe), Branding (consult CTA, non-Stripe). 1 Stripe Product, 4 Prices. Branding never writes to `accounts.plan_tier`.
- **LD-14** `accounts.plan_tier` column: text, CHECK `('basic','widget')`, NULL allowed (trialing accounts before first checkout). Webhook derives from Price ID matched against `lib/stripe/prices.ts`.
- **LD-15** Trial default tier = Widget (full app capability during trial). On trial expiry, account is locked and must pick a tier on the 3-card billing page. Existing 5 v1.7 grandfathered accounts follow the same path — no special-casing.
- **LD-16** Branding CTA destination is `process.env.NSI_BRANDING_BOOKING_URL` (= `https://booking.nsintegrations.com/nsi/branding-consultation`). Same-window navigation, no API call, no DB write.
- **LD-17** Widget tier gating happens on TWO surfaces: public `/embed/[account]/[slug]` (renders gated message, NOT 404 — must not break iframes) + owner-side embed-code settings page (replaces embed code with upgrade CTA). The bare booker `/{account}/{slug}` is NEVER gated (LD-07 extension).
- **LD-18** Phase 42 single-plan UI on disk is to be refactored in-place by Phase 42.5 — not thrown away. SC-5 plumbing (customer linkage, no-store cache, 2s/30s polling, return flow) is preserved.

### Phase 41 decisions (carry into Phase 42+)

- **plan_interval CHECK:** Accepts both Stripe payload values (`month`/`year`) AND CONTEXT vocabulary (`monthly`/`annual`). Phase 42 normalizes (don't write `monthly`/`annual` from checkout — write what Stripe gives back via webhook).
- **stripe_webhook_events:** RLS enabled with zero policies = service-role-only access (no anon/authenticated reads).
- **Trigger function (production):** INSERT cols: `owner_user_id, owner_email, slug, name, timezone, onboarding_complete, onboarding_step, subscription_status, trial_ends_at`. All Phase 10 columns preserved.
- **Stripe API 2026-04-22.dahlia field migration:** `current_period_end` moved from `Stripe.Subscription` to `Stripe.SubscriptionItem` — access via `sub.items.data[0]?.current_period_end`. Invoice subscription reference moved from `invoice.subscription` to `invoice.parent?.subscription_details?.subscription`. Phase 42 checkout code referencing these fields must use the new paths.
- **Phase 43 invariant:** `/api/stripe/webhook` MUST be exempt from the paywall middleware auth gate (invoked by Stripe servers, not authenticated users). Failing to exempt will break the billing state machine.
- **Local build placeholder:** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` placeholder values added to `.env.local` (gitignored). Stripe SDK throws at module init if key is absent; placeholder is never used in API calls.
- **Stripe Dashboard v2 UI restriction:** Stripe's "+ Add destination" UI defaults to v2/Event Destinations source which doesn't include `customer.subscription.*` or `invoice.*`. Workaround: `stripe webhook_endpoints create` CLI bypasses the UI restriction. Phase 44+ may need same workaround for additional endpoints.
- **SC-5 deferred to Phase 42:** Phase 41's "real Stripe trigger writes to a real accounts row" success criterion was not exercised because no `accounts` row has `stripe_customer_id` set yet. Phase 42's first checkout naturally creates this linkage. Phase 42 verification should include a "first checkout end-to-end" sign-off that captures this.

### Carried patterns from v1.7

- `getSenderForAccount` factory fail-closed contract — Stripe webhook email dispatch (Phase 44) uses same pattern
- `isRefusedSend(error)` dual-prefix helper — reuse for billing email error handling
- 5xx-only formError gate for enumeration-safe actions — preserved in magic-link helper (Phase 45)
- Knip CI gate is active — RESOLVED for lib/stripe: tsconfigPaths() + tsconfig @/* -> ./* covers @/lib/stripe/* generically (no explicit alias needed)

### Open tech debt (carried unchanged)

- PREREQ-03 (Resend live activation) — framework shipped; live activation gated on DNS
- Lockfile regeneration under Node 20 — knip CI gate dormant
- Vercel env-var cleanup — delete inert `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `GMAIL_FROM_NAME`
- `slot-picker.tsx` on disk — Plan 30-01 Rule 4
- Pre-existing test fixture failures — `tests/bookings-api.test.ts` + `tests/slots-api.test.ts` date-sensitive
- Pre-existing working-tree drift — three pre-existing modified files (Phase 02/23/33 docs)

### Blockers

- ~~Phase 41 deploy: PREREQ-A + PREREQ-D~~ ✅ Resolved 2026-05-10
- ~~Phase 41 live test: PREREQ-F~~ ✅ Resolved 2026-05-10
- Phase 42.5 blocked on: PREREQ-B revised (create 1 Product with 4 Prices: Basic-Monthly, Basic-Annual, Widget-Monthly, Widget-Annual; capture all 4 Price IDs) + PREREQ-D revised (10 env vars: 4 Price IDs + 4 cents amounts + `NSI_BRANDING_BOOKING_URL` + Vercel deploy) + PREREQ-E revised (4 pricing amounts) + PREREQ-G new (`checkout.session.completed` added to webhook `we_1TVfOTJ7PLcBbY73Groz1G13` enabled_events list)
- Plan 42.5-04 (webhook plan_tier write) blocked on: Andrew running `npx supabase db push --linked` to apply Plan 42.5-01's migration `20260510130000_phase42_5_plan_tier.sql` to the live Supabase project. Plan 42.5-02 is NOT blocked.
- Phase 44 blocked on: PREREQ-C (Customer Portal config — must enable plan-switching across all 4 Prices)

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-11 — Executed Plan 42.5-01 (plan_tier schema migration). Created forward + rollback SQL, verified trigger compat by reading Phase 41 trigger source, committed as `feat(42.5-01) e890334`. Local Supabase Docker stack unavailable (privilege issue); remote `db push --linked` deferred to Andrew per "live testing" handoff convention. SUMMARY.md written with full manual-verification checklist.

**Stopped at:** Plan 42.5-01 SUMMARY committed. Awaiting (a) Andrew running `npx supabase db push --linked` to apply the migration to live Supabase, AND/OR (b) kicking off Plan 42.5-02 (`prices.ts` 4-SKU refactor) which is DB-independent.

**Resume file:** None — next action is either `/gsd:execute-plan 42.5-02` (parallel-safe) or wait for Andrew to confirm the live migration applied before starting 42.5-04.
